# ML-Class_Assignments
As part of class assignments, I have worked extensively with various machine learning algorithms to perform predictions in both supervised and unsupervised learning contexts. These projects involved:

- **Supervised Learning:**
  - Implemented regression algorithms such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees for predicting continuous variables.
  - Applied classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests for categorical outcome prediction.

- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - Utilized clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to identify patterns and group similar data points.
  - Employed dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify data and enhance model performance.

These projects have provided hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and validation, ensuring a robust understanding of the practical applications of machine learning algorithms.
